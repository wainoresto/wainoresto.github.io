# Portfolio
Hi, this is a space in which I am learning how to use the GitHub.
I'd like to build some experience and learn how to leverage this space for professional use cases and presentation.

What is my experience?
- Technical writing and illustrating
- Maintenance and manufacturing
- Engineering specification interpretation
